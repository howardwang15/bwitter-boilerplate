# Bwitter Boilerplate

This is the boilerplate/starter code for ACM Dev Team's training project!

Bwitter is a simple copycat of the popular Twitter application. What the B stands for? Idk...maybe bruin? Or basic?

## Getting started

Clone this repository to your local machine.

This project has 2 main directories- the `client` and `server` folders. The client and server code is separated into their respective directories.

To run the project, take a look at the README.md files inside each directory.

## Finishing up

To test if the project works at the end, you should have a `Dockerfile` in both the `client` and `server` directories and a `docker-compose` file in the root directory.
